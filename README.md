# Tetrified-
A game of Tetris wouldn't hurt. This game was built for my programming class. I've been trying to upgrade my coding skills and creating these projects are a way for me to test my abilities! That's why, I want to make as many projects I can! In that way, I'll be able to take my coding skills to the next level!
